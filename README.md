# compressive_sensing-linear_program

We simulate the working mechanism of a single pixel camera using a mathematical model built based on a literature review. We consider three compressive sensing optimization algorithms: basis pursuit, basis pursuit denoising and LASSO. We compare performances of these algorithms with their linear program (LP) equivalents on webcam images. The code uses CVXPY, SCIPY and SPGL1 Python libraries for the several optimization procedures.
